# 🧩 CTF Writeups — by TheM3chanik

This repo is my vault of writeups — event runs, practice challenges, and random puzzles I broke at weird hours.  
Expect raw artifacts, scripts, recovered files, and the mental notes that actually mattered.

## 🧩 What’s inside

- **Reverse Engineering** — binaries, patching, decompiles.
- **Crypto** — ciphers, encoding chains, and brute tricks.
- **Web** — auth, flows, injections, and weird HTTP logic.
- **Forensics** — images, dumps, memory and timeline digging.
- **OSINT** — footprinting, crumbs, and social breadcrumbs.
- **Other** — boot2root, CTF-like multi-step challenges, misc labs and anything that doesn’t fit above.

All folders contain artifacts (images, scripts, dumps) alongside writeups — some neat, some messy. Nothing useful gets deleted.

## 📂 How to navigate this repo

- Open top-level folders (event or collection names).
- Inside each folder you’ll usually find per-challenge subfolders. Each challenge folder **should** contain a `README.md`. Start there.
- If a challenge folder has scripts or `requirements.txt`, run them in an isolated env to reproduce results.

If a folder lacks a `README.md`, check for files named `flag.txt`, `decoded.*`, `fixed.*`, or `*.py` — those are the solved outputs and helper scripts.
