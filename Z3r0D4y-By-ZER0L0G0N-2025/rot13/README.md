### 🧩 First Impressions

A simple-looking cipher — and that `mreb` prefix instantly screams “rot” to my overcaffeinated hacker brain ☕.  
Looks like a ROT cipher, most probably the classic **ROT13**. Let’s test the theory.

### 🧮 Breaking It Down

Popped it into [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/), applied the **ROT13** operation,  
and got the beautifully decrypted string:

```

zero{should_have_encrypted_3_times}

```

### 🧠 Final Decoding

Bruh... that was easier than microwaving noodles 🍜  
If only all crypto challenges were this chill.

---

### 🏁 Flag

```

zero{should_have_encrypted_3_times}

```

### 💡 Takeaways

Sometimes, the simplest cipher hides behind the loudest cryptic name — don’t overthink, just rotate 😎
