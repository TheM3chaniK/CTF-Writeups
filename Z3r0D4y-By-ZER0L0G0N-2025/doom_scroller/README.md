### 🔎 Digging for Clues

They dropped a random YouTube **Shorts** link and said *“find the name of the show”*.
Classic OSINT bait 😏

I opened it, and immediately went — “Wait… I’ve seen this before… somewhere…” 🤔
But memory decided to play hide and seek 😭

So, I called my bestie — **Google Lens** 🕵️‍♂️📱

Lens scanned the frame and confidently whispered —

> “It’s from *Modern Family*.”

Aha! That’s the one.

### 🧩 Final Deduction

According to the flag format, the answer is:

```text
zero{modern_family}
```

### 🏁 Flag

```
zero{modern_family}
```

### 💡 Takeaways
* Never underestimate the power of the simplest tools.
* While others overthink, just let Google Lens do its magic 😎
* Sometimes OSINT is less about hacking skills and more about smart scrolling.
