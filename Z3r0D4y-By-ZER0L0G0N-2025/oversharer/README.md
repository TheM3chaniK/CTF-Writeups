### 🔎 Digging for Clues

Alright — a Reddit post and an emotional rant about late trains 😤  
Classic Indian Railways experience, I feel you bro.  

Here’s what the OP said:
```

I was supposed to catch the Kanpur Central Express today.
It was scheduled (I repeat, scheduled) to arrive at my station at 3:20 AM.
Guess what time it actually rolled in? 4:14 AM.

````

Hmm, **Kanpur Central Express** and a **3:20 AM stop time** — that’s our breadcrumb trail right there 🕵️‍♂️  

Let’s check the **timetable** for the Kanpur Central Express.  
Scrolling through its route online, I spotted something interesting 👀 —  
the train halts at **Fatehgarh** exactly at **3:20 AM**.

That’s it. OP basically doxxed themselves unintentionally through train timing. Oversharer indeed 😂

### 🧩 Final Deduction
