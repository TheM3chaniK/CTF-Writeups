## 🧠 Analysis

- Step 1: Initial Thoughts  
As soon as we saw image, we thought of using `steghide` to extract any hidden file in it. But using `steghide` require a passphrase. We tried to brute force using Macbeth lines as a word list but it failed
    ```bash
    $ steghide extract -sf Peacee.jpeg
    ```

- Step 2: Digging Deeper with Binwalk
    ```bash
    $ binwalk -e ./Peacee.jpeg
    ```
    In this extracted folder we found a folder named `Chaos`
- Step 3: Finding the Hidden Truth  
Inside the `Chaos/` folder, we discovered a hidden file: `.truth.jpg`. Hidden files (starting with .) can be overlooked easily—this was the key!
Opening `.truth.jpg` in a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even cat) revealed the flag embedded as plain text.
