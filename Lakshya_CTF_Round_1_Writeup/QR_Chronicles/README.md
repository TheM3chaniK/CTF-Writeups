## 🧠 Analysis

- Step 1: Understanding the file  
  Opening the [secret_1_.xlsx](./secret_1_.xlsx) file we saw in the 1st column there (row,col). We thought maybe it was some type of coordinates (x,y)

- Step 2: Plotting graph using the coords
  We made a custom python [script](./script.py) to plot the graph
  ```bash
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  $ python3 script.py
  ```
- Step 3: Understanding the graph  
  Looking at the graph it surely was a qr code.

- Step 4: To make it look more like qr we had to change our py code little bit
- Step 5: Scanning the QR  
  When we scan the qr we found
  ```bash
  n00bz{qr_c0d3_1n_4_t3xt_f1l3_w0w!!!!!!}
  ```

## 🏁 Flag

```bash
LakshyaCTF{n00bz{qr_c0d3_1n_4_t3xt_f1l3_w0w!!!!!!}}
